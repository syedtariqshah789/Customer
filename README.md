# ML Projects
This repository includes some very basic but very important machine learning algorithms. These basic machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, linear regression, SVM, KNN and K-Means Clustering are the foundation of AI and machine learning. The implementation of these algorithms help in understanding supervised and unsupervised machine learning. These programs also introduce you to machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas that are essential when importing datasets and implementing machine learning programs. With tools like google colaboratory, the implementation and understanding of machine learning programs with all of its necessary libraries and essential algorithms has become quite interesting and accessible to all. For anyone new to machine learning, I will definitely suggest understanding and implementing these basic machine learning algorithms as it will surely help you grasp the fundamentals of machine learning.
